# DSGA1004 - BIG DATA

# Overview

For the final project, we applied the tools we learned in this class to build and evaluate a recommender system.  While the content of the final project involves recommender systems, it was more an opportunity to integrate multiple techniques to solve a realistic, large-scale applied problem.

We built a Recommender System for recommending new songs to users.  we used PySpark and the GPU computing Cluster at NYU to create, train and evaluate the model. The recommendation model used Spark's alternating least squares (ALS) method to learn latent factor representations for users and items. The training data had approximately 1M users' data.
